// Statement and Expressions
/*
An expression is a piece of code that produces a value, such as:
3 + 4
1991
true && false && !false

A statement is like a bigger piece of code that is executed and which does not produce a value on itself.

A declaration is like a complete sentence and expressions are like the words that make up the sentences.
We Write our code as a sequence of actions and these actions are statements. 
if (23 > 10) {
  const str = '23 is bigger';
}
*/

// This works because the first one is an Expression
console.log(`I'm ${2037 - 1991} years old`);

// This Doesn't Work because the second one is a Statement 
// console.log(`I'm ${2037 - 1991} years old and ${if (23 > 10) {
//   const str = '23 is bigger';
// }
// }`);
